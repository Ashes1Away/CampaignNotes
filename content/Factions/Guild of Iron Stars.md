## Description

The Guild of Iron Stars is a conglomerate of wealthy merchants, traders, and shipping magnates who view both pirates and privateers as threats to their wealth. Rather than relying on governments, they employ their own heavily armed mercenary fleets to defend their convoys. The Guild's influence stretches to the highest echelons of political power, and they manipulate star systems through wealth and economic pressure. They are also rumoured to secretly negotiate with certain pirate factions when it serves their interests.

## History

Originally a coalition of independent merchants and trade houses, the Guild of Iron Stars formed during a period of rampant piracy that disrupted commerce across the galaxy. Realizing that government forces were too slow or corrupt to provide adequate protection, the Guild invested heavily in its own private fleets, hiring elite mercenaries to defend their convoys. Over time, the Guild grew from a defensive organization into a powerful economic cartel, controlling much of the galaxy’s trade.

Under the leadership of [[Magistrate Loriel Voss]], the Guild has become one of the most influential organizations in the known universe. Voss’s cunning ability to broker deals—both legal and illegal—ensures that the Guild’s interests are always protected, whether through diplomacy or force. Although they claim to stand against piracy, the Guild is known to secretly make deals with certain pirate factions, ensuring their wealth flows uninterrupted.
