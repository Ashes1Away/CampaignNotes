## Description

The Starlance Coalition is a formidable fleet sponsored by the wealthiest spacefaring kingdoms and corporations. While they officially act as protectors of lawful commerce, their privateers are known to wield as much greed as the pirates they hunt. Captains are often given free reign to seize pirate loot in exchange for their services. Their flagship, _[[The Aegis]]_, is rumoured to be nearly indestructible, a dreadnought fitted with the latest astral technologies and magical wards.

## History

The Starlance Coalition was formed after several wealthy star systems, crippled by pirate raids, banded together to create a unified force to protect their trade routes. Originally a defensive pact, it quickly transformed into a more aggressive fleet of privateers, empowered by royal charters to hunt pirates and seize their loot. With backing from powerful merchants and nobles, the Coalition grew into a formidable force, known for its uncompromising stance against piracy and its willingness to operate outside the law if it meant securing victory. Over time, their reputation became one of ruthless efficiency, though critics argue their tactics are no better than those they claim to fight.

Admiral Lysander Trask, once a decorated naval officer, leads the Coalition with an iron fist. After losing his family to a pirate raid, Traskâ€™s personal vendetta against piracy drove him to take extreme measures. Under his command, the Coalition has expanded its operations into distant star systems, becoming a dominant force in spacefaring warfare. However, their increasing power and influence have made them as feared as the pirates they combat.
