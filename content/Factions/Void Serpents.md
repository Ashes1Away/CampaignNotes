## Description

The Void Serpents are a group of reckless pirates who favour fast, nimble ships and strike without warning. Unlike the more organized [[Black Nebula]], they act as opportunistic raiders, looting what they can and disappearing into the stars. Known for their daring attacks on highly guarded convoys, their hit-and-run tactics make them difficult to track or confront directly. They have no permanent base and often hide out in asteroid fields or unexplored planetary systems.

## History

The Void Serpents began as a small group of thrill-seeking pirates who revelled in the chaos of deep space raids. Founded by [[Captain Zyrelda]] a former noble-turned-pirate, the faction quickly grew infamous for their audacious hit-and-run attacks on heavily guarded ships and space stations. With no fixed base and no care for long-term wealth, the Void Serpents became a roving band of marauders, striking fast and disappearing before any military force could retaliate.

[[Captain Zyrelda|Zyrelda's]] mastery of astral magic and her ship, _[[The Serpent’s Fang]]_, allow her to stay one step ahead of pursuers. Her crew is fiercely loyal, bound by the excitement of battle and the promise of plunder. Though smaller than some of the galaxy's pirate factions, the Void Serpents’ unpredictable nature and guerrilla tactics make them a constant threat to anyone traveling through the stars.
