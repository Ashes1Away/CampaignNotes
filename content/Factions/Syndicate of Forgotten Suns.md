## Description

The Syndicate operates in the shadows, manipulating pirates, privateers, and governments alike. Unlike traditional pirate groups, they prefer subterfuge and intrigue over open raids. Their operations include smuggling rare artifacts, illegal weaponry, and controlling black markets. They’re also known for brokering secret deals between pirates and privateers, taking a cut from both sides to fund their hidden agendas.

## History

The Syndicate of Forgotten Suns began as a loose network of smugglers and criminals operating in the forgotten corners of space, far from the reach of law or order. Over time, under the leadership of  [[The Veil|"The Veil"]], the Syndicate transformed into a shadowy empire, controlling vast swathes of the galaxy’s black markets and illicit trade routes. They thrive on secrecy, manipulating pirate factions, privateers, and even governments to serve their interests.

[[The Veil|"The Veil"]], a former pirate captain, realized that true power lay not in direct confrontation but in the control of information, resources, and alliances. The Syndicate is now a covert but omnipresent force, moving pieces across the galactic chessboard to maintain dominance. While many pirates work in the open, the Syndicate’s power lies in its ability to influence events from behind the scenes, ensuring that no one—even their enemies—can rise too high without their approval.
