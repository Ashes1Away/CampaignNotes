## Description

The Astral Knights are a chivalric order dedicated to defending star systems from pirates and ensuring freedom for those who live in the outer rim of civilized space. They believe in an ancient code of honour and fight for justice, often engaging both pirates and tyrannical privateers alike. The Astral Knights are scattered and operate in small bands, with no centralized command, but they are united by a common cause: to bring hope to the lawless reaches of the galaxy.

## History

The Astral Knights trace their origins to an ancient order of star bound warriors sworn to protect the weak and uphold justice across the galaxy. Formed during an era of interstellar chaos, the Knights saw themselves as the last defenders of honour in an increasingly lawless universe. They are bound by a strict code, which places the protection of innocent lives above all else, and they often find themselves in conflict with both pirates and tyrannical governments alike.

Though their numbers have dwindled in recent centuries, the Astral Knights remain a symbol of hope in the darkest corners of space. [[Sir Andros Thane]], a young idealist, has revitalized the order, gathering a new generation of warriors willing to stand against the rising tide of corruption and lawlessness. Operating in small, independent bands, the Astral Knights roam the stars in search of injustice, hoping to restore peace to a galaxy teetering on the edge of chaos.
