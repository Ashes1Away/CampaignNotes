## Appearance

Rynn, the Purveyor of Vices, presents a striking figure clad in luxurious fabrics that cling to their form like a second skin. Their countenance is an enigmatic blend of allure and danger, with eyes that gleam with the promise of forbidden pleasures. Rynn moves with a sinuous grace, each step a deliberate invitation to indulge in the darker desires that lurk within the hearts of mortals. Adorned in opulent jewels and intricate tattoos that tell tales of indulgence and excess, they exude an aura of irresistible temptation that draws the unwary into their web of vice.

## History

In the celestial annals, Rynn's history intertwines with the enigmatic machinations of various deities, their influence shaping the path of temptation and vice throughout the realms. Born from the shadows cast by the god's indulgence and desire, Rynn emerged as a manifestation of humanity's darkest impulses.

As the eons unfolded, Rynn's presence grew, their name whispered in hushed tones by mortals who succumbed to the allure of vice. They traversed the realms, weaving a tangled web of temptation that ensnared even the most steadfast souls, their influence spreading like wildfire.

Among the deities, Rynn found kinship with those who revelled in decadence and excess, forging alliances with the likes of Taralk, and Fyngra. Together, they wove a tapestry of temptation that spanned the cosmos, drawing mortals into a never-ending cycle of desire and indulgence.

But as Rynn's influence grew, so too did the ire of those who sought to uphold virtue and righteousness. They clashed with deities such as Heldia, and Mikalar, whose followers stood in staunch opposition to the spread of vice.

In the cosmic dance between light and darkness, Rynn remained a shadowy figure, their history shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Yet, their legacy endured, a testament to the enduring power of temptation and the eternal struggle between virtue and vice that defines the human condition.

## Worship
  
In the dimly lit sanctuaries devoted to Rynn, worshippers gather in clandestine gatherings, drawn by the allure of forbidden pleasures and the promise of indulgence. Known as the Followers of Vice, these devotees embrace the darker aspects of their nature, seeking to appease their desires under the cloak of secrecy.

Clad in attire that reflects their hedonistic inclinations, the Followers of Vice engage in rituals that celebrate excess and gratification, offering up offerings of opulence and decadence to their enigmatic deity. They revel in the intoxicating embrace of Rynn's presence, surrendering themselves to the seductive allure of vice.

Central to their worship is the belief that true enlightenment can only be found through the pursuit of pleasure without restraint. Inspired by Rynn's embodiment of temptation, the Followers of Vice embrace their deepest desires and darkest impulses, casting aside the shackles of morality in favour of unbridled indulgence.

In addition to their ritualistic practices, the Followers of Vice also engage in acts of defiance against societal norms and conventions, challenging the status quo and embracing the taboo with fervour and abandon. They see themselves as champions of freedom and liberation, forging their own path in a world constrained by rules and regulations.

As stewards of Rynn's legacy, the Followers of Vice undertake a sacred duty to embrace the darkness within and without, knowing that in the pursuit of pleasure lies the key to unlocking the mysteries of existence. They revel in the forbidden fruits of Rynn's domain, embracing vice as a guiding principle in their quest for fulfilment and self-discovery.
