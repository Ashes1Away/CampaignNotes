The galaxy is ruled by a delicate and dangerous balance between six powerful factions, each vying for control in an age of lawlessness and piracy. The **[[Starlance Coalition]]**, a formidable alliance of trade nations, wages a relentless war against the chaos, using privateers to hunt pirates and enforce order. Opposing them are the notorious pirate crews of the **[[Black Nebula]]**, rumoured to be on the verge of resurgence under the legendary [[Captain Varn Blackclaw]], and the **[[Void Serpents]]**, a cunning and unpredictable force led by [[Captain Zyrelda]] “The Fang.” Meanwhile, the **[[Guild of Iron Stars]]** manipulates both sides, ensuring its trade empire flourishes through secret deals and mercenary fleets. The **[[Astral Knights]]**, noble warriors sworn to justice, fight to protect the weak from both pirates and corrupt officials, while the **[[Syndicate of Forgotten Suns]]** pulls the strings of the underworld, controlling the flow of illegal goods and information. With alliances shifting and the return of old legends, the galaxy teeters on the brink of chaos.
