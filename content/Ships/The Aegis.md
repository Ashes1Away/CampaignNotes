## Description

The _Aegis_ is the flagship of the [[Starlance Coalition]], a colossal, heavily-armed dreadnought designed for long-range combat and leading large-scale military campaigns. Sleek yet imposing, the _Aegis_ is equipped with cutting-edge starship weaponry, including plasma lances, energy shields, and a powerful warp drive for rapid deployment across the galaxy. Its intimidating presence often turns the tide of battle before a shot is fired, as it symbolizes the [[Starlance Coalition|Coalition’s]] iron-fisted resolve to eradicate piracy.
## History

The _Aegis_ was commissioned shortly after [[Admiral Lysander Trask|Lysander Trask]] rose to the rank of Admiral, becoming the spearhead of his brutal campaign known as the [[Timeline#**76 PSC Trask’s Blood Hunt**|Blood Hunt]]. Built to embody [[Admiral Lysander Trask|Trask's]] uncompromising pursuit of justice, the ship has led countless assaults on pirate strongholds and is responsible for the decimation of many pirate fleets. Under [[Admiral Lysander Trask|Trask's]] command, the _Aegis_ has gained a fearsome reputation, often arriving with little warning to rain destruction upon those who defy the [[Starlance Coalition|Coalition’s]] authority. It has been involved in some of the most significant battles in recent history, including the notorious [[Siege of Echo Station]].
