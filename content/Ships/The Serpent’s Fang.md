## Description

The _Serpent's Fang_ is a sleek, agile frigate renowned for its speed and stealth, making it the perfect vessel for hit-and-run tactics across the galaxy. Outfitted with cloaking technology, quick-charge weapons, and nimble manoeuvrability, the _Serpent's Fang_ can appear without warning, strike quickly, and vanish into the void. Its sleek, serpentine design reflects the [[Void Serpents]]' emblem, striking terror into the hearts of those who spot its tell-tale shadow too late.

## History

The _Serpent's Fang_ was originally a [[Crescent System|Crescent]] noble’s warship before [[Captain Zyrelda]] stole it during her defection from aristocratic life. Under her command, the ship has become legendary for its audacious raids, including the infamous attack on the [[Iron Highway]], where the ship’s speed and stealth allowed it to evade even the most heavily armed escorts. [[Captain Zyrelda|Zyrelda]] outfitted the ship with advanced astral magic wards and a cloaking system, which, when combined with her mastery of astral navigation, allows the _Serpent's Fang_ to appear from seemingly nowhere. It is as much a weapon of fear as of war, as its mere mention causes merchant fleets to double their security.
