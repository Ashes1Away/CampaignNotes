## [[Creationist Myth]]


In the beginning, [[Primordan - Light of Creation|Primordan]], the Light of Creation, emerged from the cosmic void, envisioning a multiverse filled with life and wonder. [[Primordan - Light of Creation|Primordan]] forged the Ethereal Plane, a realm of raw magic, and from it, created the Elemental Planes, where fire, water, earth, and air harmonized. Through cosmic precision, [[Primordan - Light of Creation|Primordan]] crafted the Material Plane, bringing life into its dormant landscapes with the help of [[Eelyf - Giver of Life|Eelyf]], the Giver of Life. As creation flourished, [[Kaylin - Bringer of Peace|Kaylin]], the Bringer of Peace, and [[Nemorias - Recorder of Fate|Nemorias]], the Recorder of Fate, maintained balance, soothing conflicts and weaving destiny. Over time, a pantheon of Major and Minor Deities arose, each embodying unique aspects of existence—guiding heroes, shaping nature, and tending to the souls of mortals. However, the influence of Fallen Deities, like [[Slorn - Shaper of Chance|Slorn]], [[Rynn - Purveyor of Vices|Rynn]], and [[Taralk - Visage of Pride|Taralk]], brought corruption, tempting mortals with chaos, vice, and pride. Together, this cosmic pantheon shaped the fates of the multiverse, guiding mortals through trials and triumphs across the infinite realms.

## [[Modern History]]


The galaxy descended into chaos after the [[Great Stellar Collapse]], which shattered trade hubs and isolated star systems, igniting the Age of Piracy. Lawlessness spread, with pirate factions like the [[Black Nebula]], led by the legendary [[Captain Varn Blackclaw]], rising to prominence. In response, the [[Starlance Coalition]] formed to restore order, while factions like the [[Void Serpents]] and the [[Syndicate of Forgotten Suns]] grew in power. [[Admiral Lysander Trask]] launched a brutal anti-pirate campaign known as the [[Timeline#**76 PSC Trask’s Blood Hunt**|Blood Hunt]], but rumours of [[Captain Varn Blackclaw|Blackclaw's]] return fuelled tension. As pirate raids continue and secretive powers manipulate events, the galaxy stands on the brink of war, with the fate of all hanging in the balance.
