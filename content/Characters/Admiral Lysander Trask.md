## Appearance

Trask is a tall, imposing figure, always dressed in the sharp uniform of a high-ranking officer. His face is lined with the scars of battle and the weight of loss, his grey eyes reflecting a deep, unyielding hatred for pirates. Despite his cold demeanour, Trask commands unwavering loyalty from his fleet, as his crews know he would never hesitate to lead them into battle personally. His flagship, _[[The Aegis]]_, is both his weapon and his symbol of power, a near-indestructible warship feared throughout the stars.

## History

Admiral Lysander Trask is a hardened veteran of countless space battles, with a reputation for uncompromising efficiency. Once an idealistic naval officer, his worldview was shattered when a pirate raid claimed the lives of his family during a routine merchant voyage. The event turned him into a relentless and cold leader, willing to do whatever it takes to eradicate pirates. His pursuit of justice has often crossed into the realm of vengeance, leading him to push the [[Starlance Coalition]] to its extremes, sometimes operating outside legal boundaries to achieve victory.
