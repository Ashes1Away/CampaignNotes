## Appearance

Zyrelda cuts a striking figure, with her violet hair and tattoos glowing faintly with enchanted ink. She moves with the confidence of someone who knows they are always two steps ahead of the law, and her piercing green eyes hold a mischievous glint. Her unpredictable nature and refusal to bow to any authority have made her both a feared enemy and an inspiring figure to those who live on the edge of the galaxy. Despite her wild nature, Zyrelda is a tactical genius, always choosing the perfect moment to strike.

## History

Captain Zyrelda "The Fang" is a flamboyant and unpredictable pirate queen, known for her wild raids and fearless demeanour. Once a noble who turned her back on a life of privilege, Zyrelda embraced the pirate life with reckless abandon, founding the Void Serpents and terrorizing the galaxy’s wealthiest convoys. Her signature ship, _[[The Serpent’s Fang]]_, is as sleek and deadly as its captain, capable of outrunning any pursuer. Zyrelda is known for her mastery of astral magic, which she uses to enhance her ship's speed and perform daring, almost impossible attacks.
