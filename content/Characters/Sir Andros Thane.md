## Appearance

Andros is a handsome, charismatic figure, with a strong jawline and a gleam of determination in his eyes. His golden hair and noble bearing often give him the appearance of a hero from a forgotten age, though he is more humble than he appears. Clad in shining armour and armed with his ancestral blade, _Starfall_, Andros leads his small band of Astral Knights across the galaxy, protecting the weak and inspiring hope wherever they go. Despite the odds stacked against him, he remains steadfast in his belief that justice will prevail.

## History

Sir Andros Thane is the young and idealistic leader of the Astral Knights, determined to restore peace and justice to the galaxy. Raised in the traditions of honour and chivalry, Andros took up the mantle of leadership after his mentorâ€™s death at the hands of a pirate raid. Though inexperienced, his pure-hearted dedication to the Knights' cause has rallied a new generation of warriors to his side. Andros believes that the only way to end the chaos of the galaxy is to provide a shining example of justice, even if it means taking on pirates, corrupt governments, or rogue privateers.
