## Appearance

Voss is strikingly elegant, with sharp features and a calm, composed demeanour that rarely betrays her true emotions. Her eyes are always calculating, and she has a reputation for never letting an opportunity pass her by. Often draped in luxurious fabrics and adorned with symbols of her wealth, Voss commands attention wherever she goes. Though she may appear unassuming, few dare to cross her, as her reach extends far beyond mere trade routesâ€”into politics, espionage, and even piracy itself.

## History

Magistrate Loriel Voss is the mastermind behind the rise of the Guild of Iron Stars, a savvy businesswoman who transformed the guild from a defensive merchant alliance into an economic superpower. Coming from a background in high finance, Voss realized early on that true power came not from brute force but from wealth and the ability to control interstellar trade. Under her leadership, the Guild has outmanoeuvred pirates, governments, and privateers alike, maintaining a delicate balance between legitimate trade and covert dealings with the criminal underworld.
