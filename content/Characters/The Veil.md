## Appearance

"The Veil" is a master manipulator, known for playing multiple sides against one another while reaping the benefits from the chaos. Their voice, when heard, is soft and soothing, though it hides a razor-sharp mind capable of predicting the moves of their enemies long before they make them. Underneath the mask, they are rumoured to have suffered grave injuries during their early days as a pirate, but they have turned this weakness into a strength, using the anonymity and secretive nature to control the Syndicate and its vast web of illegal operations.

## History

"The Veil" is the shadowy leader of the [[Syndicate of Forgotten Suns]], a figure more myth than man. A former pirate captain, they was known for their skill in evading capture and manipulating rivals. After several successful raids, they realized that true power lay in controlling the flow of goods, information, and peopleâ€”thus, they shifted from raiding to orchestrating a criminal empire. They are never seen without their signature mask of shifting light, which constantly changes form, obscuring their true face and creating an aura of mystery and fear.
